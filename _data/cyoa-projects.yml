  description: "An open-source platform for distributed real-time temporal graph analytics, allowing you to load and process large dynamic datasets across time. By doing this, you are able to see how networks evolve (known as dynamic graphs). Current systems for analysing graphs were built with static graphs in mind, making them cumbersome when dealing with the time aspect. If you wanted to analyse the graph at a new time point, you would have to reload the entire dataset, which is slow and efficient, especially with Big Data becoming the norm in data science. Raphtory addresses this problem by automatically updating the dynamic graph as new data comes in. The software keeps a rolling record of any changes to the nodes and links, giving users instant access to the graph's entire history."
