<p style="padding-bottom: 15px;">Imposter syndrome is a sneaky sense of self-doubt that makes you feel alone. But never doubt that there’s a place for you in the open source community! 

<br/><br/>

Hear from OSD mentors and project representatives who share their own struggles with imposter syndrome and encourage first-time contributors to take the leap.

  <b>What is your advice for first-time contributors?</b>

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Saheli</b>: "GHC is an amazing experience. You will take home some of your best memories. So just give it your best shot and enjoy."

  <br/><br/>
  <b>What's your open source story? How did you get started?</b>

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Saheli</b>: "My open source story is nothing extraordinary. Being in grad school for over 7 years, it's kind of a rule of thumb to stumble upon open source. It started with having a common, accessible, safe place to save small class projects and ended in having hours and hours of browsing as well as contributing to open source."

  <br/><br/>

  <b>What are you excited about for OSD?</b>
  <br/><br/>

  <b>Saheli</b>: "I am excited about new ideas and challenges. On one side, I am excited to be a part of this new experience, but also as a mentor, I am thrilled to know what kind of questions and queries people come up with and what better way I can help them with their mission and vision."

  <b>What is your advice for first-time contributors?</b>

  <br/><br/>
  
  <b>Laura</b>: "Never hesitate to ask questions! Making a first contribution can initially be tricky, but the mentors participating in Open Source Day are happy to help. This goes for the open source community in general – questions from new contributors are always welcome, and it's the best way to learn. It's completely normal to feel unsure of what you're doing, but this is where asking questions comes in. You're not alone, and you are in exactly the right place."

  <br/><br/>
  <b>What's your open source story? How did you get started?</b>

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Laura</b>: "I entered the open source community when I became a Ceph Storage intern at Red Hat, right after completing my undergrad. This was my first time working on a large open source project, and I have since learned a lot about community, collaboration, teamwork, and contributing to a large codebase.

  <br/><br/>

  Many beginning developers worry a lot about getting their foot in the door, or whether they are starting out too late. In my opinion, you can never start too late. As for getting your foot in the door, open source is a fantastic place to start for developers, no matter what your skill level. Whether you contribute a smaller code cleanup or a more complex feature, you are building your developer portfolio while also helping out the open source community."

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Why did you choose to participate in OSD?</b>
  <br/><br/>

  <b>Laura</b>: "For many women, it can feel intimidating to put their ideas out there, but events like Open Source Day are changing that. I feel so honored to be a part of this change, and I'm looking forward to working with all of the new contributors."

  <br/><br/>

  <br/><br/>
  
  <b>Maribeth</b>: "I've been a software engineer at Google for 6 years, and I now work full time on Blockly. Before joining Google, I was a student, and I was never brave enough to try to contribute to open source projects back then. I am fortunate now that my job allows me to work on open source projects and interact with a wider community of developers."

  </div>

  <b>What is your advice for first-time contributors?</b>

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Muazma</b>: "It can be intimidating to start open source contributions; stay consistent and patient. Open source contributing isn’t just about writing code. Open source projects need help on various things, starting with coding, but also things like designing UI/UX, writing and updating documentation, managing timelines, fixing bugs, and answering questions. All the best – you can do this!"
