  <b>What is your advice for first-time contributors?</b>

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Farah</b>: "It’s very common for first-time contributors to a project to have questions on how to get started. Don’t be shy to reach out to project maintainers to ask for help! You could ask a question in the project’s chat group or comment on an issue or even ask a question directly in your pull request. As a project maintainer myself, we welcome these questions and really enjoy helping new contributors get started on our project."

  <br/><br/>
  <b>What's your open source story? How did you get started?</b>

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Farah</b>: "My open source story started when I was studying computer science in university. I had the opportunity to do a 16 month internship as a software engineer at Red Hat. At the time, I knew a little bit about open source but hadn’t made any contributions yet. My internship was my first big exposure to open source. Right away, I became really excited about the idea of becoming a contributor! By the time my internship was done, I had made lots of contributions to the JBoss Application Server project that’s now known as the WildFly application server. Fast forward to today and I now lead security for WildFly!"

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Why did you choose to participate in OSD?</b>
  <br/><br/>

  <b>Farah</b>: "It’s no secret that women are underrepresented in open source projects. This means that we’re missing out on ideas and contributions from a large chunk of the population. That’s why it’s so important to really try to increase the number of contributions to open source projects that are made by women. As a female maintainer myself, when I first heard about OSD, I thought it was a great way for me to finally take action and really try to make a difference! It’s so inspiring to be part of the largest female-led movement in open source and see all the amazing female maintainers that are out there."

  <br/><br/>

  <b>What are you excited about for OSD?</b>
  <br/><br/>

  <b>Farah</b>: "I’m really excited to help participants make their first contributions to open source! It’s so much fun getting to meet everyone and help them take that first step in their open source journeys."

  <b>What is your advice for first-time contributors?</b>

  <br/><br/>
  
  <b>Vini</b>: "Woohoo!! You crossed the difficult part of your journey by being here. Next step is to familiarize yourself with the project. Start by looking at the project documentation or the getting started guide to install the project. Play around with it. Your first contribution can start with Good First Issue, opening a PR, reporting a bug, or a feature request. If you feel you are not ready, join the project community channels – it might be a Slack channel, Google group, or Discord. Don’t be shy to observe how people are participating in the discussions, ask questions, seek help in getting your code reviewed, and get engaged in the discussion. Good luck!"

  <br/><br/>
  <b>What's your open source story? How did you get started?</b>

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Vini</b>: "I started with open source many years ago with Linux as a part of building cloud infrastructure at Citi. I started contributing more into open source when I entered into building the Data Science platform. With my passion for data and machine learning, I would go on Kaggle to find a dataset and do a project on it. Innovation and open source goes side by side. I would find emerging machine learning libraries and incorporate them into our platform so we could bring innovative approaches to our projects at Citi. Working with Apache Spark was remarkable and was pivotal for my career. I was doing experimentation for a deep learning project which involved running some heavy computational workloads. I was not getting enough performance out of MapReduce, so I used Apache Spark. The project outperformed with the faster processing and we started implementing Spark across all our Data Science workloads. Later, I joined a company founded by the creators of Apache Spark. I have been involved with many open source projects, including Delta Lake and MLflow, since joining Databricks."

  <br/><br/>

  <b>Why did you choose to participate in OSD?</b>
  <br/><br/>

  <b>Vini</b>: "Open source is the foundation of a lot of things I achieved in my career. Having worked in the open source space for many years, I want to give back to the community and bring more diversity in the field. I love this initiative by Grace Hopper, where there is a full day dedicated to open source where it brings together mentors, mentees, speakers, and the open source projects themselves."

  <br/><br/>

  <b>What are you excited about for OSD?</b>
  <br/><br/>

  <b>Vini</b>: "Open source welcomes all levels of technical expertise, whether it's people from academia or well-established company professionals. OSD gives me the opportunity to meet many enthusiasts who are waiting to do their first open source contribution. I get to be a part of their first contribution by being their mentor. I hope to come out of the event with long-term connections."
